  There are many things I am looking forward to this summer. My family likes to go o vacations in the summer. Since some of our planned vacations will not happen here are some I look morward too. One that I am excited about is that I get to spend more time with my family. Another thing I am excited about is that I will do a summer project> my summer project will be building a bird house. This is something I want to do because I think it will be fun.
