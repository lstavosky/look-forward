    One thing that I am excited about this suummer is that I get to spend more time with my family. This is important because I really don't get a lot of time with them. My weekday schedule is usually very busy to were I almost every day get home after 6:00PM. So having all this time means that I get to see them and hang out, This also will be a good time for us to bond by doing actvities together. This time will allow us to go on walks, ride our bikes and play games together. All of this is why I am looking forward to spending time with my family.
